          "content": "“Know thyself” is a timeless philosophical principle etched onto the ancient Greek Temple of Apollo in Delphi. Sounds pretty silly, don’t we all know who we are? For me, that was not a question either, until I realized that I didn’t know that. I could fill the questionnaire with the facts of my life: what school I went to, what my height is. But what constitutes what I call me – that was covered in mystery. Who am I? What is my life? Am I living it right? Am I a good person? Am I brave? Honest? What if the push comes to shove? Will I help? Will I betray? Who knows…\n\nTo find the answers to these existential questions I had to dig deeper to find the source, the roots, so to speak. And it turned to separate the wheat from the chaff I had to somehow adopt the objective viewpoint. Otherwise, I would be fooling myself again. To apply the scientific method of self-discovery I had to assess my behavior in different situations. Staying objective towards oneself is not an easy task when you are the observer and the observed. To make things easier I came up with the rule of life:\n\nDo not lie, especially to yourself.\n\nSince you are the easiest people to fool. Be brutally honest, then you can get a foothold. In the following years, the Do Not Lie mantra has revealed itself as the bedrock of existence. It acts as an antidote to a psychic phenomenon Buddha identified as the ‘clinging’. It’s sticking to our personal interpretation of reality. Since the day we are born, we unconsciously dissect and classify every experience we undergo, our minds grasp onto viewpoints, beliefs, and opinions. We adhere to customary rituals to the extent of fixation. Our bodies seek sensory gratification, craving stimuli for all five senses. In addition, there’s an odd lens that distorts our perception of ourselves. The mind sticks to everything, wants more, and whispers in our ears. Strangely it became obvious that I was wanting and doing things I regretted later.\n\nTo combat this I stopped lying completely. At first, it felt a little strange, but in a good way. I stopped doing things I couldn’t later tell about. This immediately improved my life quite a bit. I stopped being involved in shady stories. And the story of my life began to straighten out. I stopped being afraid of being judged. I stopped being afraid of being myself. I stopped being afraid of being.\n\nAfter such success, I had to keep my professional life in order. And the second rule popped up:\n\nDon’t deal with jerks.\n\nIf someone sets you up on small stuff, they will do it when shit hits the fan. You can’t totally avoid them. Sometimes they can be your co-workers and professionals. Just don’t get involved with them. And, because it is crucial to find the right people, someone you can trust, the flipside rule:\n\nDon’t be a jerk.\n\nDo not lie. Don’t do stupid things. And the right people will see you. Those, whose intentions are good, won’t be misunderstood. The good guys will see you. The rest will eventually fall off the wagon.\n\nOnce I came up and internalized these simple rules, they became an essential part of the “me” framework. This is how I started to change myself. This triad has served me well since.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Stop doing stupid things. Stop lying. Stop making things worse.\n  \n        \n          Jordan Peterson\n      \n\n  \n\n\nSince then I’ve read numerous books on Psychology, Neurology, and Brain Functioning, digging for insights to fix and enrich life. It held more potential than I could imagine with my little brain. Over the next few years, I moved in self-discovery more than I had in my entire life before. I fixed myself.\n\nThe next turning point was the discovery of microdosing. Then the pace of events began to accelerate. A couple of years combined with contemplation and the exploration of Buddhism surpassed everything before. Turned out that Buddhism Psychology dealt with the same experiences and understanding of life that I had. It reassured me that I was on the right path. And I’ve realized I can’t do anything for myself anymore. So I started improving the lives of people around me. And that improved my life even more.\n\nYou just need to start pulling the thread to pull yourself out. Here are my ideas on how to understand how to live your own life. What I wish somebody explained it to me. Something they forgot to teach in the schools and at home. Not many people know what they are doing, so they can’t tell you how to live. I couldn’t find a book that encapsulated the essentials either. So, this is that book. This is what I wanted to hear when I was young. This is what I tell my kids. As it turns out, I had been holding it wrong. Life that is.\n\nTo start pulling yourself out you need to ask the right questions. This is akin to Zen Koans. Koans are a kind of philosophical paradox, often masquerading as a joke, like “If the tree is falling and there is no one will it make a sound?”. This sounded ridiculous until I realized that the answer was not “Of course it will make a sound, we can even record it”, it’s “Right, to perceive the air vibrations as a sound there should be someone to hear it”. An observer.\n\nBuddha warned that you can’t save everyone, let’s help those who can be helped. This is what led me to a healthier, happier, and more mindful life. This is what worked. You need to think a certain way so I wrote down the insights and thoughts that will help.\n\nLet’s dive into understanding how we function and what we can do with this. Join me on this journey of self-exploration. To uncover the source of sustainable joy in our lives. Every journey starts with a single step. Try a simple question for starters:\n\nWho are you?"

Is it solely your physical form?\n\nIf you were to lose an arm, would you be any less “you”?\n\nOr is it perhaps the awe-inspiring wonder that is your brain, a marvel in its own right?\n\nWhen one passes away the physical structure of the brain remains unaltered, holding the memories and knowledge amassed over a lifetime. \nYet we can’t say by brain scans did the person knew English? Could they ride a bicycle?\n\nConsciousness, that unique essence we often refer to as “I” fades into the background.\nAs if the vibrant orchestra of the mind falls silent.\n\nThe essence of life, your true self, doesn’t reside within the intricate network of neurons or the matter of the brain itself. \nIt thrives in the intangible spaces between those neurons, in the ethereal connections that define the essence of your existence. \nIt is in this ineffable realm that your consciousness truly resides, giving life its rich tapestry of thoughts, emotions, and experiences.\n\nIt is the profound electrochemical reaction, an ethereal flame that courses within. \nThat is the true essence of your being.\n\nIt is this internal spark that illuminates your existence.\n\nHow come we know very little about ourselves?\n\n\nOur body is formed before we appear. It lives and functions before a consciousness emerges within it. \nBefore we come into being. We step into a fully operational vehicle.\n\nHow do you become aware of something that has existed since before you were born? \nStrangely, we often overlook our very own body, despite it being our constant companion. A solitary cell that we inhabit since the very beginning.\n\nThe sixth sense\n\n\nWe know the basic five senses: Vision, Taste, Touch, Hear, and Smell. \nIn Buddhism, they consider the sixth sense – The Mind or consciousness itself. \nThe mind is regarded as the sixth sense because it is the primary means through which we experience and interact with the world.\n\nBuddhist teachings emphasize the importance of understanding and mastering the mind to develop greater insight, clarity, and wisdom.\n\nBut wait, what are those?\n\n\nTurns out we sense a lot more. Balance, Temperature, Pain, Position. The body is constantly sending us signals. Where are our limbs? Are we moving? Are we falling? Is it cold? Where is up?\n\n\n\nStretch, Pressure, Vasolidation, Acceleration… The list goes on. Some researches agree on 21 senses, some go up to 53. One this is certain, though. We are always connected to this endless stream of body signals. This has started before we were born, before we become aware of ourselves, we don’t even notice it anymore.\n\nOur sense of self is closely tied to our physical body. We are blind wisemen in out bodies trying to comprehend an elephant in a dark room. \nIs it like a rope, a wall, or a tree? We touch the world around us with all our senses.\n\n\n  “Sensation is the raw material of consciousness. Perception is the finished product of sensation. Knowledge is the result of perception. Wisdom is the culmination of knowledge.” - Idries Shah\n\n\nBut, okay, it is what it is, we feel the world around us, one way or another. Can we even trust our perception?"

Yep.

The modern humans appeared in the last seconds of the last minute.\n\n\n  Formation of Earth: 00:00 (4.5 billion years ago)\n  First Life Forms (Prokaryotes): 01:15 (3.5 billion years ago)\n  Photosynthesizing Organisms: 02:00 (3 billion years ago)\n  Oxygenation of Atmosphere: 03:30 (2.4 billion years ago)\n  Complex Cells (First Eukaryotes): 04:45 (2 billion years ago)\n  Multicellular Life: 06:45 (1 billion years ago)\n  First Animals: 08:00 (600 million years ago)\n  Diverse Marine Life (Cambrian Explosion): 08:30 (540 million years ago)\n  First Land Plants: 09:45 (470 million years ago)\n  Dinosaurs: 11:15 (230 million years ago)\n  Dinosaurs Wiped Out: 12:45 (65 million years ago)\n  Early Human Ancestors: 14:30 (6-7 million years ago)\n  Modern Humans (Homo sapiens) Emerged: 17:45 (300,000 years ago)\n  The Last Ice Age: Ended around 11,700 years ago (23:59:48).\n\n\nThe whole dinosaur civilization was wiped out in about an hour and a half.

Every human being is related genealogically not just to all other humans, but to all other living things. And not only organisms living today, but to everything that has ever lived.\n\n\nThe fact of life is we not only have common ancestors. We are related closer than one might think.\nThis also applies to the evolution of our brain. We have common brain structures and behaviours as well.\n\nUnlike animals, the newborn doesn&#8217;t recognize mother&#8217;s face, voice, or feel fear, nor do they understand dangers. This difference can be explained by the anatomy of the brain and the embryo&#8217;s developmental history. These science shows that a baby&#8217;s brain is far from being as developed at the time of birth as an animal&#8217;s brain. Out of the vast number of nerve cells, only a very few are fully developed when a child is born. The majority are underdeveloped and incapable of functioning."

The replitian brain, the monkey brain and the human brain.\n\nThey all work in unison and the human baby grows through all phases.\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Reptilian Brain (Brainstem): This is the most primitive part of our brain, often referred to as the &#8220;reptilian brain&#8221; because it&#8217;s similar to the brain structure found in reptiles. It&#8217;s responsible for basic survival instincts like aggression, dominance, territoriality, and the fight-or-flight response. This part of the brain is associated with our most fundamental needs and instincts.\n  \n  \n    Monkey Brain (Limbic System): This is the next evolutionary stage and is sometimes referred to as the &#8220;monkey brain&#8221; because it&#8217;s similar to the brain structure found in mammals. It&#8217;s primarily responsible for emotions, memory, and social interactions. This part of the brain allows for more complex behaviors and responses compared to the reptilian brain.\n  \n  \n    Human Brain (Neocortex): This is the most recent evolutionary addition and is what distinguishes us from other animals. It&#8217;s sometimes called the &#8220;human brain&#8221; or the &#8220;thinking brain&#8221;. This part of the brain is responsible for advanced cognitive functions such as logic, reason, language, problem-solving, and abstract thinking. It&#8217;s what enables us to plan, innovate, and create complex societies.\n  \n\n\nDuring the development of a human baby, these three parts of the brain go through various stages of growth and maturation. The reptilian brain is crucial for basic survival instincts in early stages of life. The monkey brain develops as the child starts to interact with their environment and other people, experiencing emotions and forming memories. Finally, the human brain, particularly the neocortex, undergoes significant development as the child grows, allowing for higher-level thinking and complex cognitive functions.\n\n\n\nIn essence, these three parts of the brain work together in a seamless manner, each contributing to different aspects of our behavior and cognition. This layered evolution is a testament to the complexity and sophistication of the human brain."

It’s universal and needs no explanation. It’s the reason even a single-celled organism seeks nourishment, and it’s what compels a plant to reach for the sunlight. The love for life is often expressed as a deep-seated instinct to protect oneself, to seek out nourishment, and to form connections with others.\n\n\n\n  Twist your head around  \nIt’s all around you  \nAll is full of love  \nAll around you\n  \n        \n          Björk\n      \n\n  \n\n\nLook at the children, they are happy and curious.

It’s the fuel that powers our lives. It’s a pity that somewhere along the journey, that vibrant inner light begins to dim.\n\n\n\nOnce you feel that you have this spark inside, you might be able to keep it burning. This primal emotion is the foundation upon which all other feelings and behaviors are built. It’s the source of our vitality, our resilience, and our innate drive to persevere through challenges. Even in the face of adversity, the love for life fuels our determination to overcome obstacles and find meaning in our existence.\n\nIn essence, it’s the heartbeat of life itself, echoing through every living being, reminding us of the preciousness and value inherent in every moment of our existence. Without that innate feeling, our journey on Earth would lose its meaning. There is no point of suffering all the time. Even the deep-sea creatures, living in the darkness under a constant pressure, or the bacteria living in volcano, they don’t seem to be bothered with their conditions. They just live.

Even though a bacterium doesn’t possess consciousness or feelings, it has an inbuilt mechanism that guides it away from harmful environments. This instinct for self-preservation is the very foundation upon which the tapestry of life is woven.\n\n\n\nIt emerges from the deepest layers of our nervous system. This primal emotion arises from our reptilian brain, the ancient guardian of survival. Then it travels via the neural pathways through the limbic system. There fear gets mixed and blended with various hues and other signals.\n\nFear takes on different forms. It becomes greed, the insatiable appetite for more. It transforms into envy, longing for what others possess. It morphs into jealousy, guarding what we believe is rightfully ours. In the grand gallery of human emotions, fear is both the canvas and the hidden brushstroke that gives depth and complexity to our inner world.\n\nEssentially it is pulling us back, limiting our options. It whispers into our ears:\n\n— You are not going to make. It’s too risky. They will laugh. They are going to judge you. You don’t need it. Everything is fine.\n\nAnd instead of creating our lives we sit with an anxious heart, literally paralyzed by imaginary troubles of the unknown waves yet to come.\n\n\n\nThus, we find ourselves suspended between what’s to come and what’s already been, yearning for control over tides we can’t predict or reverse.

The chronic stress literally shrinks your brain.\n\n\n\nWhen you’re stressed, your body releases cortisol, often called the ‘stress hormone.’ In small doses, it does important jobs. It helps regulate blood pressure, keeps blood sugar steady, and reduces inflammation. Our bodies have a natural response to stress, and cortisol steps in as the main player. Think of it as the body’s way of gearing up to face a challenge. The cortisol rises in the morning so you wake up and get out of bed.\n\nBut here’s the catch. When stress becomes a constant, cortisol levels stay high for prolonged periods. This exposure starts reshaping our brain, and not in a good way. Specifically, it leads to a shrinkage of certain brain areas. Two regions that take a hit are the hippocampus, which is our brain’s librarian, overseeing memory and learning, and the prefrontal cortex,the  conductor of our thoughts, emotions,and actions. You can think of them as essential command centers of the brain.\n\nChronic stress doesn’t just play havoc with our emotions. It makes learning, remembering, and decision-making tougher. And those functions are essential for living the pro-active life, instead of mindlessly reacting to whatever goes around. And if you are not making conscious decisions, the mind is falling behind like a muscle that weakens without regular exercise. The brain changes organically, the structural integrity of our brain is at stake.\n\n&lt;!—- TODO:  —-&gt;\n\nBasically you devolve back into a monkey. That’s why easing the existential fear, accepting what is going on, is the most effective way of getting rid of stress. It isn’t just a luxury or self-hipnosis — it’s a necessity for our well-being and brainpower."

This is not an achievment, it is normal. It is the norm.\n\nYou can&#8217;t always feel happy, but you can be content. I would argue that in the abscence of worry and fear one could start feeling the joy of being alive. The inner joy. True peace and tranquility arising from within, independent of circumstances, possessions, or other factors. It is something that must be cultivated and discovered within oneself, in one&#8217;s own mind and heart.\n\nThe consistent good mood is an indicator. It&#8217;s the blank piece of paper, the still surface of the mind&#8217;s reservoir. It serves as the backdrop against which dark spots or waves immediately visible. You need to become accustomed to consistently being in a good mood. And then it&#8217;s automatic.\n\nYou wake up and something feels wrong, you&#8217;ll notice it right away. However, if you fail to recognize the darkness and don&#8217;t take active steps to address it, it will engulf everything."

          "content": "The so called “Flammarion engraving” is a famous woodcut illustration that first appeared in Camille Flammarion’s book “L’atmosphère: météorologie populaire” (The Atmosphere: Popular Meteorology) in 1888. The illustration depicts a medieval scholar, often interpreted as Flammarion himself, reaching through the outermost celestial sphere to observe the mysteries beyond.\n\nA naïve missionary of the Middle Ages even tells us that, in one of his voyages in search of the terrestrial paradise, he reached the horizon where the earth and the heavens met, and that he discovered a certain point where they were not joined together, and where, by stooping his shoulders, he passed under the roof of the heavens.\n\nThis engraving has become an iconic representation of the human quest for knowledge and the exploration of the unknown. It’s often used in discussions about the limits of human understanding, the pursuit of truth, and the idea that there are realms of knowledge yet to be discovered.\n\nThe engraving has also been adopted in various contexts, including popular culture, where it’s sometimes used to represent themes of curiosity, exploration, and the search for deeper meaning.\n\nBefore tearing the fabric of reality let’s see how much we know about it. Our main sensory organ — the brain is not giving us a complete picture. We are always confined withing our senses and understanding.\n\nOur sensory organs (eyes, ears, nose, skin, and tongue) can only detect a certain range of stimuli. We see only a range of colors within the electromagnetic spectrum, hear a certain range of frequencies, and so on.\n\n\n\nOur brains process sensory information and make assumptions based on prior experiences. This leads to misinterpretations and illusions. And we miss out on details of events happening outside our attention.\n\nReality is a web of intricate systems and phenomena. Everything is interlinked in ways we can scarcely imagine.\n\nIt is a constant flow, making it impossible to pin down. Our senses and cognition can’t fully capture the depth and breadth of reality. At the subatomic level, particles defy our usual understanding of existence. The universe likely extends far beyond what our senses can fathom.\n\nPerspectives vary, each individual experiences and interprets reality uniquely. Concepts like time dilation and quantum entanglement defy logic as we know it. Our sensory perception is limited, we’re seeing only a fraction of a vast landscape. Recognizing the vastness of what we don’t know is a mark of wisdom.\n\nOur perception provides us with a subjective, filtered version of reality. It’s a constructed representation that allows us to navigate and interact with the world, but it’s not an exhaustive view of objective reality.\n\nEverything we experience come through three lenses:\n\n\n  Sensory: This is our senses, shaping how we perceive the world around us.\n  Socio-cultural: This lens is created from our environment. It is the cultural and historical context in which we live.\n  Individual: This lens is unique to each person. It is their personal history, experiences, and perspective.\n\n\nThe ultimate reality is inconceivable. We are experiencing only a tiny sliver of it. And to pack what’s going in our heads, we are telling ourselves stories about who we are and what we do."

          "content": "Science is a systematic approach to understanding the world around us. We use science to observe, measure, experiment, and formulate theories about the natural phenomena we encounter. This scientific method allows us to study the tangible aspects of reality, the things we can touch, see, and measure.\n\nChristianity played a significant role in the development of science in the West. During the Middle Ages, Christian thinkers were driven by a desire to understand the intricacies of God&#8217;s creation. They believed that by studying the natural world, they were uncovering the workings of the Divine. This perspective led to a surge in scientific inquiry.\n\nScholars believed that by uncovering the basic elements of creation, they were peering into the mind of God. This philosophical backdrop provided a fertile ground for the growth of modern science, encouraging scientists to delve deeper into the mysteries of the universe.\n\nBut this is just the world of things, where the action take place. It&#8217;s a backdrop for the game that takes place in our heads. We construct personal narratives or myths to make sense of our lives as we go along. We always tell ourslves stories about  and what we do.\n\nWe are all storytellers, crafting narratives that we think might help us navigate the complexities of life. These stories are not fictional. This is our interpretation of reality. The most important is what myths we are telling ourselves about what is going on. What are we doing? Are we winning?\n\nThose stories unfold in a fictional space in our heads which is a reflection of the world around us. But as we know reality is much more than we can comprehend. So we pack the parts of it into the mind map in our head. The map of meaning.\n\nWhile science aims to measure and explain the tangible world of things, the map of meaning is a more abstract construct. Unlike scientific maps that chart physical territory, maps of meaning chart the psychological and emotional terrain of our inner world.\n\n\n  Ask yourself: What do you believe is going on in you life right now?\n\n\nA person&#8217;s map of meaning is constructed from a blend of personal experiences, cultural narratives, and philosophical views. It incorporates elements from their upbringing, background, beliefs, and personal reflections. It shapes how we interpret events, assign meaning to experiences, and define our values. It steers the story we tell ourselves. What do you believe is going on right now?\n\nScience deals with empirical evidence and observable phenomena. The map of meaning grapple with abstract concepts like purpose, morality, and the nature of existence. They help us make sense of the human condition, providing a framework for understanding why we&#8217;re here and what we&#8217;re meant to do. This is where religion, philosophy, and personal introspection come into play. These maps are essential for navigating the complexities of life beyond the physical realm.\n\nAa map of meaning might help an individual find purpose in their work, relationships, or personal pursuits. It offers solace in times of adversity, providing a sense of direction and a framework for understanding life&#8217;s challenges."

This stage is about the hero&#8217;s transformation and growth\n\nReturn: The hero returns to their ordinary world, bringing back the elixir, a reward or treasure that will benefit others.

          "content": "Before we continue with the story, let&#8217;s take a step back and look where our mythical journey takes place.\n\nHere is a simple representation of the human psyche:\n\n\n  Body: The body is an Earth suit that we wear or better say inhabit. This is the physical vessel that houses our soul. It&#8217;s a vehicle that we use to enter the physical world. The exoskeleton for the mind. The body interacts with the external environment, experiences sensations, and carries out survival functions. The body has it&#8217;s own intelligence. It is controlled by the Reptile Brain structures, with the help of the spinal cord. It is capable of acting independently and it has built-in reflexes that protects us and not letting you hurt yourself.\n  Mind: It encompasses our thoughts, emotions, perceptions, and cognitive functions. It&#8217;s the seat of our consciousness and intelligence. The mind interprets the external world, processes information, and influences our behavior. It&#8217;s directly plugged into the body. Whatever happens in the body, the mind is aware of it. This is the part of you that thinks, feels, and experiences the world. It is controlled by the Monkey Brain. It it always checking the scene, if the grass is greener and if you are keeping up with the Joneses. Hence the constant nagging feeling of dissatisfaction because someone else has it and not you.\n  Soul: The spiritual essence, the soul is seen as the eternal, unchanging core of a person. It&#8217;s associated with deeper meanings, purpose, and a sense of connection to something greater than oneself. The soul is what many religions and philosophies believe transcends the physical realm. It is what we mean by consciousness, identity, I. This is the real you.\n\n\n\n\nImagine yourself as a walking human-shaped flower pot. Inside this pot, there&#8217;s a beautiful, vibrant flower, which represents the true essence of who you are. Your soul dwells in your body, experiencing and interacting with the world. The brain is the soil, the soul lives somewhere in the neural pathways between the cells.\n\nThe body provides it with the means to interact with the external world. It holds and nurtures the flower, gives it life. The flower, your soul, provides consciousness, and identity. It&#8217;s the part of you that feels, thinks, and experiences the world in your own personal way.\n\nJust as a flower needs care, sunlight, and nourishment to blossom, your soul needs the right conditions to flourish. Not just taking care of your physical health, but also nurturing your emotional, mental, and spiritual well-being. When all these aspects are in harmony, the flower is blooming in its perfect pot.\n\nYour task in this world is to cradle and support the flower of your soul. Water it with positive emotions. It&#8217;s a unique and intricate relationship that defines your existence and shapes your experience of the world.\n\nBut somehow instead of flying like fairies we&#8217;re crippled by anxiety an everyday stress. What went wrong?"

We are always sizing ourselves and everybody up, comparing how we are doing and automatically filling in the pre-defined place. We are always in a hierarchy of some kind.\n\n\n\nMaslow’s pyramid is a well-known blueprint that outlines of human needs and motivations. It’s a visual representation of the steps we take to meet our various needs, starting from the most basic ones at the bottom, and progressing upwards.\n\nThe top of the pyramid, shown within the triangle, exists beyond the confines of the pyramid itself. It’s the way out. To be on the top actually means to be outside of it. The originally white Egyptian pyramids had a golden capstone. Which symbolize the transcendence to a higher plane. The white base represented the earthly realm and the struggles of mortal life, while the golden top signifies the the divine.\n\n\n  The mountains you are carrying you’re only supposed to climb.\n\n  ― Najwa Zebian\n\n\nAnd it is the same with the Maslow’s pyramid. The ultimate state of self-actualization lies outside the scope of the needs and motivations outlined within the pyramid. It’s a higher plane of existence, transcending the framework altogether.\n\nThe main goal in life isn’t just to navigate the stairs moping around merely satisfying basic requirements. The goal is to breaking free from the cycle. Do not be imprisoned for life. Close your holes, mend what’s broken, get out of it, and never come back. Transcend it – ascend to a higher place of existence. Self-realization is the closest we come to the divine.\n\nThe pyramids are a symbol of eternity, just like the world itself. And they are towering around us all as, we always in of hierarchy or another. We always measure, compare and analyze ourselves and the others. Leave one pyramid you find yourself in another. They go way up endlessly nested and connected. You will never be on the top of them all. Close your holes and get out of the one you are in.\n\n\n  It’s turtles all the way down.\n\n  — Terry Pratchett\n\n\nLook closer and you will see that down below are the bottomless depths of meaning. Imagine a deep well. As you peer into it, you realize it stretching further than the eye can see. Each layer you uncover, each bit of understanding, only reveals more layers beneath it. Each layer of knowledge is within another, never ending. There is no bottom. “It’s turtles all the way down!”\n\nDon’t let yourself be trapped in the endless cycle of hierarchies. Don’t participate and get out of the one you are in."

It identifies three main roles: the Victim, the Persecutor, and the Rescuer. The drama triangle is infamous for its knack to draw more and more people into its dynamics.\n\n\n  \n    Victim: This is the person who feels oppressed, helpless, or in some kind of distress. They often seek sympathy and support from others, thus luring people in.\n  \n  \n    Persecutor: This role is taken on by someone who criticizes, blames, or attacks the Victim. They may appear aggressive or domineering.\n  \n  \n    Rescuer: The Rescuer attempts to help or protect the Victim from the Persecutor. Or thinks that is helping. They often do so with the intention of feeling needed or superior.\n  \n\n\nThis dynamic tends to cycle, with individuals switching roles. A Victim might eventually become a Persecutor or Rescuer when situation changes.\n\nRecognizing this pattern is crucial because it leads to unhealthy and unproductive relationships. Aim for healthier dynamics where people communicate openly, take responsibility for their actions, and seek mutual understanding. As usual telling the truth helps.\n\n\n\n  You cannot continue to victimize someone else just because you yourself were a victim once—there has to be a limit\n  \n          Edward Said\n\n  \n\n\nRecognize and avoid the Drama Triangle at all costs. Be mindful of these roles and consciously work towards constructive interactions. Foster relationships based on respect, empathy, and mutual support, rather than falling into patterns of victimization, blame, and rescue.\n\nYou can only help those who do something.

          "content": "There is this narrative going on that life is a never-endding process of overcoming one thing or another. Jordan Peterson plainly asserts that life is suffering. We could debate the exact meaning of this word. Buddha, for instance, referred to a wide spectrum of unsatisfactory experiences as suffering. To make it sound better, we could use the word “problem”. Life is full or problems. How does this sound?\n\nRegardless of the terminology, it’s widely accepted that suffering isn’t a welcome part of our lives. So, why do we seem to excel at it? Can’t we simply put an end to it and live happily? I hope we can. But if you think of it, the problems, the bad thoughts, the suffering are always drawing near. The true durable happiness is simply an absence of all these. Ask anybody if they would want their problems and worries go away. I believe the answer would be the resounding Yes.\n\nHappiness, in its essence, has a negative nature. It’s what remains when you subtract the undesirable parts. It’s a byproduct of freedom. Freedom from the vicious cycle. And this freedom, in turn, is a byproduct of self-awareness. Only when you see that everything exists in your perception you can break free from the vicious cycle. In the end thinking forward is not about reaching happiness. It’s a way on for attaining freedom. Freedom from the shackles of your own mind. Freedom from the self-imposed limitations. Freedom from the self. The joyful peaceful life you get from this is a byproduct.\n\nBefore getting to thinking forward let me explain what I call backward thinking. When you say anything mean it. You see quite often we add an escape hatch by sort of contradicting what just was being said:\n\n— It is nice, but could be better\n\nNo, it couldn’t, everything is the result of everyone doing what they could. If you see a possibility for improvement – do it, make the world better. The opinion is not required. Everything after the comma is not required and not beneficial. It makes the other person to start justify themselves and discussion steers god knows where on auto.\n\nThe cure for this is to speak in a clear and direct way. Stop adding the escape hatches, pouring the brake fluid and switching to reverse. Eliminate the “buts” and “howevers,” those anchors that drag you back. Don’t be afraid. To be able to do it, one must observe their thoughts and emotions. You have to be aware of what’s going on in your head, keeping a vigilant eye on the mental landscape. You will notice that you are about to a add counter-statement, stop.\n\n\n\nThere are countless jokes about not seeing what’s right in front of us. They are funny because it is so true. We become so entangled in our thoughts and simultaneously perplexed by external circumstances, that we overlook what’s really happening. The problem lies is in the fact that our minds are so firmly tethered to our bodies, and whatever we believe we desire, we do not have complete control over.\n\nIf you feel that life is not going the way you wanted. I propose starting with clearing the waters of the mind each of us is swimming in. Pay attention only to what is interesting, meaningful and propels you forward. In Buddhism, teachers can only provide guidance, the actual progress on the path is ultimately the responsibility of the individual. True transformation comes from one’s own actions and efforts. You have to walk the last mile yourself.\n\nLet’s start from fixing what usually goes wrong in life."

          "content": "Once upon a time in ancient China, there was a wise and renowned Zen master known not only for his profound teachings but also for his simple yet enlightening demonstrations. One day, a curious student approached eager to learn. The student asked the master to explain the nature of the mind and how to attain true enlightenment.\n\nWith a kind smile, the master gestured for the student to sit. He then began pouring tea into the student&#8217;s cup. The teacup was small, and soon it was full. But the master kept pouring, and the tea began to overflow, spilling onto the table and the floor.\n\nThe student, astonished, exclaimed, &#8220;Master, the cup is full! It can&#8217;t hold any more!&#8221;\n\nThe master calmly looked up at the student and said, &#8220;Like this teacup, you are full of your own opinions. How can you learn anything new unless you first empty your cup?&#8221;\n\nDeconditioning\n\nIn a world inundated with information and ideologies that fill our minds with different ideas, it&#8217;s impossible to keep it empty for the new stuff. In the quest for self-discovery, it&#8217;s imperative to first shed the layers of societal conditioning. This process involves dismantling long-held beliefs and venturing into uncharted territories of thought.\n\nTo get the new information in, you have to unlearn a bit of what you&#8217;ve been conditioned to through all your life. Just as the teacup needed to be emptied before it could be filled again, so too must the mind be free from preconceptions and fixed ideas. Only after letting it go, one could unveil a profound truth: we are not confined to the limits of our physical form. Try to adopt a beginner&#8217;s mind, free from the constraints of what we think we already know.\n\n\n\nWe are not our body\n\nWise people and philosophers were pondering on the nature of our physical form. Our bodies are the vessels for the journey of consciousness, the transient vehicles through which we can navigate the world. No one can tell for sure what their soul looks like. We can&#8217;t see inside ourselves. Our body is like the space suit astronauts use to go out in space. The only difference is that you are always connected to your Earth-suit. Similar to the gigantic robots in the movie &#8220;Pacific Rim&#8221;. It&#8217;s a temporary home for the soul. The soul rents this body for the life time and if we&#8217;re lucky, and if some beliefs are true, it is returned to the ocean of consciousness in the end.\n\nWe are not ourselves\n\nPerhaps, after all, you are you? Initially, the concept that we are not truly ourselves might appear perplexing. After all, isn&#8217;t our individuality the very essence of who we are?\n\nBeing human is a complex process that involves assimilating the culture of other humans and the world around us. We learn, we adapt, and we internalize the norms and values that surround us. Our minds are tirelessly processing and organizing the model of the world within us.\n\nHumans cannot exist in isolation. Tales of mancubs raised by wolves, evolving into humans, are just tales. Actual Mowglis cannot speak, nor can they grasp language and culture. Being human is a process that happens in stages. After the key stage is passed it&#8217;s almost impossible to learn some key skills like walking or speaking. They are unable to ever become truly human, despite being organically 100% humans.\n\nOur identity is not confined to the limits of our physical form. The essence of being human is not a solitary endeavor. It is intertwined with the fabric of existence. It is a neverending process of becoming. But not becoming yourself.\n\nWe absorb everything from other people\n\nThe phenomenon of a human brain is a miracle. As soon as the child comes into this world its brain starts sucking information like a vacuum. It absorbs everything. Just by looking and hearing other people speaking the child starts talking.\n\nA newborn&#8217;s mind is like an empty cup waiting to be filled with the colors of the world. So it starts absorbing the essence of the environment. Constantly internalizing the world around. And we start imitating the world around us. We inherit not only the rituals but also the implicit biases, cultural norms, and societal narratives that shape their worldview. We are becoming the people we are surrounded by.\n\nTheir myths define your roles\n\nIn the history of human existence, myths and narratives have played a pivotal role in shaping cultures, norms, and individual identities. These stories passed down through generations, have the power to mold societal expectations and, subsequently, our roles within them.\n\nThe tales that have woven themselves into the fabric of our collective consciousness. They carry archetypes, morals, and ideals that serve as guideposts for how we perceive ourselves and others. Whether it be the Hero&#8217;s journey, the Damsel in distress, or the Wise mentor, these narratives provide a framework through which we navigate the complexities of life.\n\nYet, within this intricate web of stories, lies a subtle danger. When we allow ourselves to be defined by external narratives, we become characters in a script not of our own making. Relegated to roles prescribed by societal norms and expectations.\n\nThink about the stories that have been handed down to you. Are they reflective of your authentic experiences and aspirations, or are they borrowed garments that no longer fit? Drop the narratives that no longer serve you. Craft a story that resonates with the truth of your being.\n\nBe mindful of the sources from which you draw your narratives. Not all storytellers are living the lives they describe. In a world saturated with information, it is easy to be swayed by the voices of those who do not walk their talk. Steer towards the narratives that align with your values and aspirations.\n\nStop people from defining you. Be mindful of the information you take in. See where and who it is coming from. Navigate the sea of narratives that surround you with a discerning heart. Have the courage to discard those that no longer serve you. Be the author-hero, crafting a narrative that is uniquely and authentically your own.\n\nTheir vocabulary describes your world\n\nEach word, a tiny ship, carries with it a cargo of meaning, shaping the landscapes of our minds. It is through this linguistic lens that we perceive, understand, and interact with the world.\n\nConsider, for a moment, the power of your vocabulary. The words you choose are not mere labels; they are architects of your reality. They construct the walls of your perception and lay the foundation for your understanding. In this intricate process, you are not merely a passive observer, but an active participant, shaping your world with every word.\n\nWords are not arbitrary symbols. They are carriers of culture, encapsulating generations of human experience. They encode the collective wisdom, beliefs, and narratives of societies. In this way, your choice of words connects you to a vast web of shared knowledge and history.\n\nOur vocabulary also limits our perspectives. We cannot see what we cannot name. The words we habitually employ shape the boundaries of our thoughts. They can frame our experiences, filtering out nuances and possibilities that lie beyond their scope.\n\nThus the words you are using become the world you live in. Filter your vocabulary. See what descriptions you and others around you are using. With each new addition, you open a window to fresh perspectives, inviting a more nuanced and vibrant world into your consciousness.\n\nIn this dance of words and worlds, remember that you hold the pen to your narrative. With each phrase, you are not merely describing reality; you are actively participating in its creation. So, wield your vocabulary with intention and watch as the world reshapes itself before your very eyes.\n\nTheir beliefs become your religion\n\nReligion, from Latin religare &#8216;to bind&#8217; is a unified field of belief. It doesn&#8217;t have to be connected with the church or god or anything outherworldly. It&#8217;s a set of beliefs that you are holding on to.\n\nAnd the funny part is, whatever you got used believing in, you will find the evidence for it. Then all superficial evidence will be used to support your beliefs.\n\nIt&#8217;s even more ridiculous with superstitions. You can&#8217;t really prove them wrong. Because they are not based on logic:\n\nBlack cats bring bad luck, unless you own one, apparently. Number 4 in China sounds like &#8220;death&#8221;, so they skip the fourth floor. That is similar to the number 13 in the West. Whistling indoors in Russia will cause financial difficulties. Broken mirrors, spilled salt, and walking under a ladder are all bad luck.\n\nGrowing up we start imitating the rituals, knocking on wood to ward off evil spirits. These rituals become something we believe in. Our religion. All based on the fear of the unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Your mind makes it real.\n  \n        \n          Morpheus\n      \n\n  \n\n\nIt is not real\n\nOur perceptions, beliefs, and interpretations are subjective constructs, influenced by a multitude of factors. We are happy to be fooled. Our minds are full of cognitive biases - mental shortcuts leading us to irrational judgments. These biases are a product of evolutionary processes, developed to help us make quick decisions in complex environments. We conquered the world, now they lead to misinterpretations of reality.\n\nStart unlearning. Begin with meticulously trimming down the tree of your beliefs. Start with the ones that are not serving you, holding you back, whisper in your year. And you will see that most of them are just your imagination, they are not real and never were. Disown them. Sounds easy, but you lived with them all your life. They are not eager to leave. Just refuse to believe in them. And they will start wither away like plants without the water.\n\nNegative thoughts are like cacti, they hold the fuel inside, so the process might take some time. Identify what is not serving you and don&#8217;t think it. Don&#8217;t feed it. Don&#8217;t water it. Don&#8217;t give it any attention. And it will die.\n\n\n\nThe Reading List\n\n\n  \n  \n    Alan Watts\n    The Book\n    On the Taboo Against Knowning Who You Are\n    What, then, would be The Book which fathers might slip to their sons and mothers to their daughters, without ever admitting it openly?"

          "content": "In the journey towards a better life, one must first recognize the paramount\nimportance of self-care and well-being. This is not an act of selfishness, but\nrather an elemental responsibility. There is only you in the universe of your\nmind. Neglecting own needs leads to burnout and hinders the ability to\ncontribute meaningfully to the world around you.\n\nBefore extending help to others, we must first ensure our own well-being. Fix\nyourself first. As they say in the flight booklet — put the oxygen mask on\nyourself before helping others. Two drowning people are not better than one.\n\nYou are your responsibility\n\nSelf-Prioritization first. Start with acknowledging that caring for yourself \nis not a luxury but a fundamental aspect of a healthy and productive life.\nSelf-care forms the basis of your capacity to contribute positively to the world. \nReflect on times when neglecting your well-being affected your efficiency \nand mood and use these instances as motivation to prioritize yourself.\n\nYou are not your fault. You are your responsibility. You may not have chosen \nall the circumstances of your life, you have the power and responsibility to \nshape your response. Your past may explain you, but it doesn’t excuse you. \nShift from a mindset of blame to one of ownership, recognizing that every \nchoice you make shapes your future.\n\nPersonal accountability is the cornerstone of a fulfilling life. Only you bear\nthe ultimate responsibility for the direction your life takes. Step up and take\nownership of the choices, actions, and the consequences that follow. By\nembracing accountability, you gain the power to shape your destiny.\n\nTake ownership of decisions and circumstances. Take responsibility for your\nactions and for your life. Help yourself first. With the foundation of \nself-responsibility solidified, let’s explore how order and clarity play a \npivotal role in well-being.\n\nOrder &gt; Happiness\n\nOrder and clarity in life are the prerequisite for well-being.\nOrder is not merely about organization but about creating a harmonious environment\nin which your mind and soul can thrive. An ordered space reflects an ordered mind. \nA cluttered room leads to a cluttered mind. Simple cleaning and organizing your space can dramatically improve your mental clarity and mood.\n\nPeterson in his 12 Rules for life discusses the significance of maintaining\norder and clarity in one’s life. Once everything is in order you can stop\nworrying about “stuff” and focus on the things that matter.\n\nBe the adult you needed as a child\n\nOrient yourself towards self-compassion and nurturing the inner child within.\nTreat yourself with love. Provide the care, support, and understanding you\nneeded during the formative years.\n\nThe process of healing and treating yourself with compassion is a pivotal step\ntowards self-acceptance and emotional resilience. Once you start walking along\nthis path you will move forward with strength and confidence.\n\nSet your life in perfect order\n\nBefore you criticize the world. Perfect. Start small, throw away what is\ncluttering your desk. Once you’ve organized your personal space, expand your \nefforts to your household, and then to other aspects of your life. As you help \nothers under your care, you will likely gain a clearer understanding of why things \nare the way they are.\n\nSpoiler – because there is no other way everything can be the only way possible. The way things are. And maybe the world is not that bad after all. And it doesn’t require fixing.\n\nYou’ll need the order to have a steady foundation for the next step.\n\nOne step at a time, with one foot in order\n\nZen philosophy is the art of harmonizing chaos and order in life. Despite sounding\ndelicate this equilibrium provides a stable foundation for navigating the\ncomplexities of existence. Embracing both spontaneity and structure, this balance\nlets us easily adapt to the ever-changing nature of life.\n\nAs Peterson says, one foot in order, one foot in chaos. One you have a good\nfoothold in the order the chaos of life will bring only possibilities. Taleb calls \nthis “anti-fragility”. You bend under the wind of change but never\nbreak because your life is in order.\n\nWhich is exactly what zen is about. And then start taking steps. No matter how small.\nOne step after another. Just take care of today. And don’t worry about tomorrow. Do\nyour best now. Whatever is going on you can improve it. Instead of thinking what\ncould be better – apply the change. Start spreading the order around you.\n\nNo expectations\n\nWe always get stressed when the expectations don’t match reality. And they\nnever do. The wisdom is to take care of today and not expect anything. Release\nexpectations. Let things take care of themselves. When you don’t expect anything\nreality always exceeds expectations. So you’re always pleasantly surprised. This\npractice will lead to a more harmonious existence. Once you stop expecting\nthings you will stop resisting. Things will stop happen to you. There will be no\ndisappointment and frustration that arise from holding onto rigid expectations.\nThis concept aligns with Buddhist philosophy which emphasizes the serenity that\ncomes from accepting life as it unfolds.\n\nIn Zen and Buddhist philosophies, the practice of releasing expectations is not \nabout apathy but about embracing the fluidity and unpredictability of life. \nNo expectations. No disappointment. No suffering.\n\nConsistent good mood\n\nAnd the most important – consistent good mood. Often people hide their identity,\ntolerate restrictions, and remain in bad relationships because they’re afraid.\nThis raises stress level which is causing bad thoughts that lead to more stress\nand the cycle continues.\n\nPrioritize happiness. Seek fulfillment and joy in life. Happiness is not a\nself-indulgent pursuit, but a vital component of a fulfilling life. To be always\nin a good mood is normal. Somehow the new norm is to be always offended by one\nthing or another, but that’s a lie. Break the cycle. Find meaning, genuine\nconnections, that understand and appreciate you. Actively seek out experiences,\nrelationships, and endeavors that bring joy and fulfillment. By nurturing own\nhappiness, you become better equipped to positively impact the world around you.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nTo delve deeper into the concepts and philosophies discussed in this chapter, consider the following works:\n\n\n  12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos by Jordan B. Peterson: This book provides practical principles for living a meaningful life, drawing on psychology, philosophy, and personal anecdotes.\n  Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder by Nassim Nicholas Taleb: Taleb introduces the concept of ‘antifragility,’ the idea that certain systems benefit from shocks and volatility, and explores its application in various domains.\n  For a comprehensive understanding of Zen and Buddhist philosophies, consider works like The Heart of the Buddha’s Teaching by Thich Nhat Hanh or Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind by Shunryu Suzuki."

He had a precise list of so-called defilements of the mind. They all start from Greed, Hate and Delusion. And I would add that Fear is the root of them all.\n\nDefilements are contagious, they penetrate others and play themselves. Thoughts think themselves. Each person can list what they dislike, what annoys them and what they can not stand. Anyone can tell what&#8217;s not right in their life, how things could be or should be. And with their own variations, you can infect others. Guess what, there&#8217;s no one else. This is water. You only release poison into your aquarium.\n\nThe catch is that none of the suffering exists. Discomfort is created personally in the head. It&#8217;s all imaginary. Custom-tailored to get exactly you. You can simply ignore any of that. That&#8217;s the essence of enlightenment. You start seeing through the illusion. A suitcase without a handle can be left behind; it&#8217;s no longer needed. It doesn&#8217;t exist. It never existed.\n\nKeep only good things in life. Only what you want. Everything else just doesn&#8217;t happen. Yes, something exists on the other side of the screen. Not on this side. Not on mine.\n\nNo excess. Only what&#8217;s loved. Loved people. Loved activities. Loved life. No thing else is required. Suffering not required."

          "content": "Наткнулся на это преобразовывающий сознание спич утром. Джим Керри знает что говорит. Еще один кусочек паззла, подсказывающий, что я на верном пути. Весь день думал о его словах, про выбор, который мы делаем от страха. И к концу дня испеклись новые инсайты, стало яснее что делать дальше.\n\n\n\n\nВот что я услышал в этом выступлении, переведу части, которые меня больше всего тронули.\n\n\n  Раньше я считал, что то, кем я являюсь, заканчивается на краю моей кожи, что мне было дано это маленькое средство под названием тело, чтобы пережить создание. И я не просил даже более спортивной модели, какая разница, ее придется вернуть. Потом я узнал, что все что снаружи это тоже часть меня, и теперь я вожу кабриолет. Крыша открыта, ветер развевает волосы.\n\n\nДругого способа жить полной жизнью просто нет. Это как прыжок с парашютом без снаряжения. Ты знаешь, как это закончится. Живешь в прыжке.\n\n\n  Способность пройти за кулисы сложной декорации ума и увидеть, что есть огромная разница между собакой, которая собирается вас укусить в вашем уме, и настоящей собакой, которая собирается это сделать.\n\n  Это может показаться мелочью, но многие так и не научаться отличать одно от другого. Они свою жизни в постоянной реакции борьбы или бегства.\n\n\nТак много вещей, которые мы никогда не делаем, потому что боимся даже пробовать.\n\n\n  Страх будет всегда игроком в вашей жизни, но вы решите, насколько сильна его роль. Вы можете провести всю жизнь воображая ужасы, беспокоясь о пути в будущее, но все, что когда-либо было и будет, - это то, что происходит сейчас. И решения, которые мы принимаем в этот момент, основаны либо на любви, либо на страхе. Многие из нас выбирают свой путь из страха, прикидываясь практичностью.\n\n\nПодумайте об этом. Все кроме радости и любви сделано из страха.\n\n“Страх, прикидывающийся практичностью”\n\nИ мне нравится этот момент, вселенная помогает тем, кто хочет больше:\n\n\n  То, что мы действительно хотим, кажется невероятно далеким и смешным, чтобы ожидать. Так что мы никогда не осмеливаемся просить у вселенной. Я доказательство того, что вы можете просить. Пожалуйста. И если это не произойдет сразу, это только потому, что вселенная занята выполнением моего заказа.\n\n\nЧто-то о безопасности работы и полагание на внешние силы, которые не поддаются вашему контролю:\n\n\n  Мой отец мог бы стать великим комиком, но он не верил, что это возможно. И поэтому он сделал консервативный выбор. Надеюжную работу бухгалтера. Когда мне было 12 лет, его уволили с этой надежной работы, и нашей семье пришлось делать все, что мы могли, чтобы выжить.\n\n\nО том, чтобы заниматься тем, что ты любишь:\n\n\n  Я получил много уроков от своего отца, не последний из них тот, что раз уж можно потерпеть неудачу в том, чего вы не хотите, то можно смело попробовать заняться тем, что вы любите.\n\n\nЭти замечательные слова о его отце:\n\n\n  Но это не единственное, что он меня научил. Я видел, как влияние любви и юмора моего отца меняло мир вокруг меня.\n\n\nКак водичка? Подумайте о том, какое воздействие вы оказываете на других:\n\n\n  Как тот, кто сделал то, что вы собираетесь сейчас сделать, я могу сказать вам из опыта, что воздействие, которое вы оказываете на других, - это самая ценная валюта, которая существует. Потому что все, что вы получаете в жизни, исчезнет и распадется, и все, что останется от вас, - это то, что было в вашем сердце.\n\n\nИ воздействие, которое другие оказывают на вас:\n\n\n  Ваша потребность в признании может сделать вас невидимыми в этом мире. Не дайте ничему стоять на пути света, который сияет через эту форму. Рискните быть увиденными во всей своей славе.\n\n\nИ это прям последний гвоздь. ДА! Жизнь - подарок тебе, и она предназначена для того, чтобы добывать радость.\n\n\n  Как и многие из вас, меня беспокоило то, что я иду в мир и делаю что-то большее, чем сам. Пока кто-то умнее меня не заставил меня понять, что нет ничего большего меня. Моя душа не заключена в пределах моего тела. Мое тело находится в пределах бесконечности моей души. Одно единое поле. Одно единое поле ничего, танцующее ради ни в чем не нужной причины, кроме, возможно, утешения и развлечения самой себя.\n\n\nТочно так, think forward, думай вперед. Сброс каждую секунду.\n\n\n  Когда этот сдвиг происходит в вас, вы не будете чувствовать мир, мир будет чувствовать вас. Вы будете обняты им. Теперь я всегда на старте, у меня есть кнопка сброса, и я нажимаю эту кнопку постоянно. Как только эта кнопка начинает работать в вашей жизни, нет ни одной истории, которую разум может создать, что было бы таким убедительным. Воображение всегда создает сценарии, как хорошие, так и плохие. И эго пытается удержать вас в кинотеатре ума. Наши глаза не являются только зрителями. Они также проекторы, которые запускают вторую историю над изображением, которое мы видим перед собой все время. Страх пишет этот сценарий, и рабочее название - Я никогда не буду достаточно хорош.\n\n\nА это самая важная часть:\n\n\n  И после того как вы переступите через эти двери сегодня, у вас будет всего два выбора: любовь или страх. Выбирайте любовь и никогда не позволяйте страху обратить вас против вашего игривого сердца.\n\n\nПолный текст"

          "content": "Stumbled upon this transformative speech in the morning. Jim Carrey knows what he’s talking about. Another golden nugget, affirming that I am on the right path. I couldn’t stop thinking about his words and I had some insights by the end of the day.\n\n\n\n\nThis is what I’ve heard in this performance. Here are the parts that resonated the most.\n\n\n  I used to believe that who I was ended at the edge of my skin, that I had been given this little vehicle called a body from which to experience creation. And though I couldn’t have asked for a sportier model, it was after all a loner and would have to be returned. Then I learned that everything outside the vehicle was part of me too, and now I drive a convertible. Top down, wind in my hair.\n\n\nThere is no other way to live life as full face forward. It’s like diving out of the plane with no gear. You know how it’s going to end, so let’s enjoy it.\n\n\n  You have given them the ability to walk behind the mind’s elaborate set decoration and to see that there’s a huge difference between a dog that is going to eat you in your mind and an actual dog that is going to eat you.\n\n  That may sound like no big deal, but many never learned that distinction. And they spend a great deal of their lives living in fight or flight response.\n\n\nSo many things we never do because even scared to try.\n\n\n  Now fear is going to be a player in your life, but you get to decide how much. You can spend your whole life imagining ghosts, worrying about the pathway to the future, but all there will ever be is what’s happening here, and the decisions we make in this moment, which are based in either love or fear. So many of us choose our path out of fear disguised as practicality.\n\n\nThink about it, everything except joy and love is made out fear.\n\n“fear disguised as practicality”\n\nAnd I love this bit, the universe favor those who want more:\n\n\n  What we really want seems impossibly out of reach and ridiculous to expect. So we never dare to ask the universe for it. I’m saying I’m the proof that you can ask the universe for it. Please. And if it doesn’t happen for you right away, it’s only because the universe is so busy fulfilling my order.\n\n\nSomething about job safety and relying on external forces out of your control:\n\n\n  My father could have been a great comedian, but he didn’t believe that that was possible for him. And so he made a conservative choice. Instead, he got a safe job as an accountant. And when I was 12 years old, he was let go from that safe job and our family had to do whatever we could to survive.\n\n\nAbout doing what you love:\n\n\n  I learned many great lessons from my father, not the least of which was that you can fail at what you don’t want so you might as well take a chance on doing what you love.\n\n\nThose lovely words about his father:\n\n\n  It’s not the only thing he taught me though. I watched the effect of my father’s love and humor and how it altered the world around me.\n\n\nHow’s the water? Think about the effect you have on others:\n\n\n  As someone who’s done what you’re about to go and do, I can tell you from experience the effect you have on others is the most valuable currency there is. Because everything you gain in life will rot and fall apart, and all that will be left of you is what was in your heart.\n\n\nAnd the effect others have on you:\n\n\n  Your need for acceptance can make you invisible in this world. Don’t let anything stand in the way of the light that shines through this form. Risk being seen in all of your glory.\n\n\nAnd this just hit the nail on my head, YES! Life is a gift to you and it is for mining joy.\n\n\n  Like many of you, I was concerned about going out into the world and doing something bigger than myself, until someone smarter than myself made me realize that there is nothing bigger than myself. My soul is not contained within the limits of my body. My body is contained within the limitlessness of my soul. One unified field. One unified field of nothing dancing for no particular reason, except maybe to comfort and entertain itself.\n\n\nExactly, reset every second. So you can only think forward:\n\n\n  As that shift happens in you, you won’t be feeling the world, you’ll be felt by it. You’ll be embraced by it. Now I’m always at the beginning, I have a reset button and I ride that button constantly. Once that button is functioning in your life, there’s no story that the mind could create that will be as compelling. The imagination is always manufacturing scenarios, both good and bad. And the ego tries to keep you trapped in the multiplex of the mind. Our eyes are not viewers. They’re also projectors that are running a second story over the picture that we see in front of us all the time. Fear is writing that script, and the working title is I’ll Never be Enough.\n\n\nAnd this is the best important part:\n\n\n  And after you walk through those doors today, you will only ever have two choices, love or fear. Choose love, and don’t ever let fear turn you against your playful heart.\n\n\nFull Transcript"

          "content": "История из чата. О возможнотях мозга. Человеку в прямом смысле слова удалось додумать мысль. Удержать, и не расплескать себя.\n\n\n  Не могу не поделиться историей о возможностях нашего мозга. Недавно я оказалась в лицее физико-технического института имени Капицы (https://anoo.ftl.name). Проректор, которая нас встречала и показывала нам всё, рассказала интересную историю.\n\n  Один ученик перестал общаться с внешним миром в течение 2 месяцев: опаздывал на уроки, ошибался в кабинетах, никак не реагировал на окружение. Школа начала волноваться, искала психологов и обдумывала, что делать с этой ситуацией. И вот тогда он начал разговаривать с ними на грузинском языке.\n\n\n\n  Оказалось, что он заметил некоторые сходства в написании букв грузинского алфавита с каким-то древним трактатом (по-моему, об астрономии, но я не уверена). Он разработал свою теорию на этот счет и, чтобы её доказать, решил выучить грузинский язык. За эти 2 месяца он выучил его самостоятельно, никому об этом не рассказав.\n\n\n\n  Проректор рассказывала эту историю с эмоциями в голосе, сказав, что у него одновременно шло 3 когнитивных процесса: в первом - он продолжал обучаться в лицее по серьезной программе, во втором - он разрабатывал свою теорию, а в третьем - самостоятельно учил грузинский язык. Энергозатраты были такие, что ему пришлось полностью отключиться от внешнего мира. И он справился с этим вполне успешно.\n\n\nПодобное состояние мне знакомо. Ты уходишь, как бы, на глубину и не общаешься с поверхностью. То, что приходится совершать какие-то действия помимо основной цели, помогает не распыляться и делать только важное. Но долго находиться в таком состоянии нельзя. Когда мозг устает, начинаешь творить всякую дичь, не замечая этого. Уставать нельзя. Приходится возвращать с процентами."

          "content": "A story from a friend. Tells you something about the capabilities of the brain. A person literally managed to finalize a thought. To hold onto it, and not let himself to spill the attention over.\n\n\n  I can&#8217;t help but share a story about the potential of our brain. Recently, I found myself at the Kapitsa Institute&#8217;s Physics and Technology Lyceum (https://anoo.ftl.name). The vice-rector who welcomed and showed us around shared an interesting story.\n\n  A student stopped communicating with the outside world for two months: he was late for classes, got confused in classrooms, and didn&#8217;t react to his surroundings. The school started to worry, sought out psychologists to assess the situation. And then he started talking to them in Georgian.\n\n  Turns out he noticed some similarities in the shape of Georgian alphabet with some ancient text. He developed his theory on this matter and, to prove it, decided to learn Georgian. In these 2 months, he learned it independently, without telling anyone.\n\n  He simultaneously engaged in three cognitive processes: he continued to study at the lyceum with a serious program, he was developing his theory, and he was learning Georgian. The energy drain was so high, he had to completely disconnect from the outside world. And he made it through admirably.\n\n\nI&#8217;m familiar with a similar state, where you go deeper and hardly communicate with the surface. The fact that there are additional actions to perform outside aside from the main goal helps to not get stretched and only do what&#8217;s important. But you can&#8217;t stay underwater for long. After the brain gets tired, you start making all sorts of nonsense, without even realizing it. You can&#8217;t afford to get tired, it always have to be payed back with interest."
